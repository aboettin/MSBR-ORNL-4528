Gavin Ridley, S2017

Main input --- input. A Pu-241 disk reflected by water.
mod.ifc    ---  a type 2 MP file that contains temp and rho data for the reflector.
fuel.ifc   ---  ^^^ same but fuel

To run, you need to act as the external solver. When serpent starts waiting after running neutronics,
go to com.in and change -1 to 10 to indicate to keep going. The simulation should then stop and print
out results since max iterations are set to 1.
