FIT:    data read from 'data'
        format = z
        #datapoints = 2
        residuals are weighted equally (unit weight)

function used for fitting: f(x)
	f(x) = a*x+b
fitted parameters initialized with current variable values

After 1 iterations the fit converged.
final sum of squares of residuals : 0
abs. change during last iteration : 0


Exactly as many data points as there are parameters.
In this degenerate case, all errors are zero by definition.

Final set of parameters 
======================= 

a               = 0.108087       
b               = 2.01272
